# ML-Model Linear Regression Prediction
***Project Overview***

Molecular Solubility Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of molecules based on their chemical descriptors. Accurate solubility prediction is important in drug discovery, chemical research, and material design.

***Work Done***

* Loaded and analyzed a molecular dataset containing chemical descriptors and solubility values.

* Implemented a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

* Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

* Predicted solubility (logS) and compared predictions against actual values.

* Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

* Visualized predictions vs actual solubility values using scatter plots and regression lines.

***Output***

* A regression model that predicts logS values for molecules.

* Visualizations showing how predicted solubility matches experimental data.

* Quantitative metrics (MSE, R²) to assess model accuracy.

***Achieved Output***

* Trained Linear Regression model with good predictive performance.

* Training R²: ~0.76, Test R²: ~0.79, indicating strong correlation.

* Generated regression plots showing predicted vs experimental solubility.

* Demonstrated that molecular descriptors can effectively estimate solubility.
